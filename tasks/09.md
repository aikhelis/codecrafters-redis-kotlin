## Your task
In this stage, you'll add support for creating a Redis stream using the XADD command.

## Redis Streams & Entries
Streams are one of the data types that Redis supports. A stream is identified by a key, and it contains multiple entries.

Each entry consists of one or more key-value pairs, and is assigned a unique ID.

For example, if you were using a Redis stream to store real-time data from a temperature & humidity monitor, the contents of the stream might look like this:

```
entries:
- id: 1526985054069-0 # (ID of the first entry)
  temperature: 36 # (A key value pair in the first entry)
  humidity: 95 # (Another key value pair in the first entry)

- id: 1526985054079-0 # (ID of the second entry)
  temperature: 37 # (A key value pair in the first entry)
  humidity: 94 # (Another key value pair in the first entry)

# ... (and so on)
```
We'll take a closer look at the format of entry IDs (1526985054069-0 and 1526985054079-0 in the example above) in the upcoming stages.

## The XADD command
The XADD command appends an entry to a stream. If a stream doesn't exist already, it is created.

Here's how it works:

```
$ redis-cli XADD stream_key 1526919030474-0 temperature 36 humidity 95
"1526919030474-0" # (ID of the entry created)
```
The return value is the ID of the entry created, encoded as a bulk string.

XADD supports other optional arguments, but we won't deal with them in this challenge.

XADD also supports auto-generating entry IDs. We'll add support for that in later stages. For now, we'll only deal with explicit IDs (like `1526919030474-0` in the example above).

Tests
The tester will execute your program like this:

```
$ ./your_program.sh
```
It'll then send an XADD command to your server and expect the ID as a response.

```
$ redis-cli XADD stream_key 0-1 foo bar
"0-1"
```
Your server should respond with $3\r\n0-1\r\n, which is 0-1 encoded as a RESP bulk string.

The tester will then send a TYPE command to your server.

```
$ redis-cli TYPE stream_key
"stream"
```
Your server should respond with +stream\r\n, which is stream encoded as a RESP simple string.

## Notes
You still need to handle the "string" and "none" return values for the TYPE command. "stream" should only be returned for keys that are streams.
